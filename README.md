Contest-Judging
===============

CSCE 606 Project, Team Madagascar : Contest Judging - To support many judges (could be from industry) evaluating student work (e.g. poster, prototype) in large events (e.g. 200 posters) (expect to have 200 posters this year). Set up judging categories, enter data on phone/tablet. Total up scores by category, etc.
